  <p>Welcome to my REAL website!<br>
  There isn't much here because I only know how to do text in HTML and really dont want to learn more<br>\
  until my CS class. So until then you get the gaudy white screen of boring.<br>
  Have a amazing day!<br>
  Find me on Bluesky: @weggs.org (this website!)</p>
