  <h1>INFO</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to the Waystar info page!</h2>
  <p>For those now in the know, Waystar is NOT a real company.
  It was an idea I had in 2023 during the early stages of a Roblox game I am making.
  It originally was just a simple logo. A four point star with the word 'Waystar' under it.
  The logo would go under many different iterations arriving at the tri color version of the "new-era" logo.
  While I may share a name with a healthcare payments coroporation and a HBO show, this is a totally new thing.
  <br>
  There is a google dock with the "Lore" of Waystar. It is far from complete but it might help you get more understanding of it. <br>
  You may find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXa18cJpNKjbwUBkAUNyRmB5pCwtDhVRYCsUIRYP8lA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> </p>
